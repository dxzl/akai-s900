# akai-s900
S900rs.exe converts and sends 16-bit WAV audio files to your Akai S900/S950 digital sampler.
It can also save samples from your machine to a custom file-format. And it can save/restore all of your
S900/S950 programs (patches). Works with all Windows versions (as far as I know). Requires a USB to RS232
adaptor and a DB9 to DB25 cable. You may also need a null-modem adaptor (that's always been a source of confusion!).

This project builds with Embarcadero RAD Studio 10.2 (Tokyo)
